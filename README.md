## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- PostgreSQL (locally or via Docker)
- Docker (optional)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder>
   ```

2. **Configure the connection string:**
   Update `appsettings.json` to point to your PostgreSQL instance (local or Docker).

3. **Run the application:**
   - If using local PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

   - If using Docker:
     ```bash

## Future Enhancements

1. **Structured Logging with Serilog**  
   - Integrate **Serilog** for better structured logging and support for external logging sinks like **Seq** or **Elasticsearch**.

2. **Vault for Secrets Management**  
   - Use **HashiCorp Vault** or **Azure Key Vault** to securely manage application secrets.

3. **Rate Limiting Enhancements**  
   - Add **distributed rate limiting** using **Redis** for better scalability.

4. **CQRS Pattern**  
   - Implement **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** for better separation of read and write operations.

5. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Integrate for secure API access with role-based authorization.

6. **Testing & CI/CD**  
   - Add unit and integration tests and set up a **CI/CD pipeline**.

6. **Implement more test cases**  
   - Add more unit test coverage for the application.

7. **Enhance Response Model**  
   - Enhance the response model to include more information about the request status and errors.
